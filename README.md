A five channel LED strip lighting Controller with serious audio reactivity and many display modes

The Android app communicates over Bluetooth 2.1 with the board, setting modes, and individual settings for each mode.
There is an audio input, which I was really impressed with myself for, because it introduced ZERO noise at all! The audio modes were my absolute favorite.

I stopped working on this project 7 years ago. I got mine working, as well as one for a friend, but a week after I got my prototypes in the mail and assembled them, the competitor released pretty much the same thing, ready for sale, and I gave up.

There are many different iterations, most untested, but the "defiance" version was built, and used successfully, including a $500 traffic ticket because I didn't realize it was on, and it was flashing "Red-Red", "Blue-Blue" and my car, and I got pulled over.

## Android:
I've included every copy of the source code I have found in my old backups, I didn't compile and test any at this point, since I've switched to iOS personally, and don't have any Android devices lying around. I didn't use or have any apple equipment when I started the project.

## Boards:
I've included every version I made a board for, again, only "defiance" was produced in quantity and tested thoroughly.

## Arduino:
I started with an ATmega328P, moved to a PJRC Teensy 2.0, the code is a mess of files, and I can't tell which one is the "latest" version. The longest iterations are over 2k lines, pretty well commented.

## Media:
All of the files in this directory are photos of the equipment or advertising materials I came up with.

### Links:
I recorded two videos with one of my best friends, of the ShowStopper working, on my 1993 Dodge Stealth.
